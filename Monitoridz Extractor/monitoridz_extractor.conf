# Using Windows(R) OS, double \ in path.
# E.g. C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\

# It highly recommanded to use absolute path for files and directories

[EXTRACTOR]

# Interface: the name of the physical interface on the device on which you want to sniff the network traffic.
# On Linux, generaly it is "wlp2s0" for the WiFi board and "enp3s0" for the Ethernet board.
Interface = wlp2s0

# OutputFile: (des)activate the pcap output ("on" or "off). The default is "off". If the option is activated, you must
# give the name of the future pcap file with the OutputFilePath option.
# E.g. OutputFile = /home/user/Documents/capture.pcap
# Using Windows(R) OS, double \ in path.
# E.g. OutputFile = C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\capture.pcap
OutputFile = off

# OutputFilePath: the file path to the pcap file which will be saved. If the OutputFile option is activated, this option
# should have a value
OutputFilePath =

# BPFFilter: the sniffing filter. The sythax of this option is special and described on the PyShark and the WireShark
# website (https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters, https://kiminewt.github.io/pyshark/)
BPFFilter =

# Debug: (des)activate the debug mode ("on" or "off"). The default is "off"
# If the debug mode is activated, debug message will store in a log file in the working directory.
Debug = off

# SendingInterval: the sending period. For each period, all active flows will be sent to the given IP address. See the
# [COLLECTOR] section in this file. The default is 5 seconds. The metric of the option is the Second (s). The lower
# authorized value is 1 for 1 second.
SendingInterval = 5

# DeletionInterval: the deletion period. For each period, all closed flows will be totaly delete from the program but
# these flows will be saved in the pcap file if the option is activated. The default is 60 seconds. The metric of the
# option is the Second (s). The lower authorized value is 1 for 1 second.
DeletionInterval = 60

# FlowDuration: the maximal duration of a flow. This duration is used in the definition of a flow. The default value is
# 180 seconds. The metric of the option is the Second (s)
FlowDuration = 180


[COLLECTOR]

# IpAddress: the ip address of the Monitoridz Analyser. The default is localhost (127.0.0.1)
IpAddress = 127.0.0.1

# Port: the port of which send data to the Monitoridz Analyser. The default is 8888.
Port = 8888
